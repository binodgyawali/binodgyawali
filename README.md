## Hi, I am Binod Gyawali ðŸ‘‹

I am a Machine Learning and AI Engineer with a motivation towards solving NLP problems!

* Currently, I am working in [Kasisto](www.kasisto.com) working on [KAI-GPT](https://kasisto.com/blog/kasisto-introduces-kai-gpt-a-large-language-model-that-is-purpose-built-for-banking/), a LLM that is purpose-built for banking.
* Previously, I worked at [ETS AI Labs](https://www.ets.org/research/ai-labs.html). In ETS AI Labs, I was developing features for automated scoring of written and spoken responses; and integrating features, training the models, and developing/delivering the automated scoring engines. The scoring engines that I have contributed to include [e-rater](https://www.ets.org/erater/about), [TOEFL Essentials](https://www.ets.org/s/toefl-essentials/test-takers/), ELPAC, TOEFL Junior, TOEFL Primary, etc. Other than scoring engines, I led the engineering efforts on the [RelayReader app](https://relayreader.org/) developing read aloud e-books and developing the backend application that computes features related to fluency, accuracy of the readers to provide feedback on their reading capabilities.
